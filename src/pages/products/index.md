      text: >
        Simplicity and effectiveness is key of any sustainable solution, be it
        digital or analog. Simplicity, transparency and clarity of thought
        belong to our core values. The work loads required to test, audit,
        maintain, document, teach shrink immensly. Scalibility is more likely in
        a simple setting.

      header: Open mindset & constant learning
      text: >
        Lean startup principles, agility and scrum methodology put rapid
        learning and product cycles first. Challenging your beliefs is a
        constant exercise. Each feature or idea has to be proven valuable. BI &
        data pipelines, A/B tests, metrics and KPIs need to be actionable and
        straight forward to understand.

      header: Focus on results and value
      text: >
        Anything created should have the intend to deliver more value than there
        was before. The internet is full of spam. We believe in earning our
        share in giving more than we ask for. It is common among developers that
        they put technologies first or think in their sweet spot only. We are
        very aware of these common traps and put product and value creation
        first.

        Better understanding of the customer can only result in better products
        if the new learnings are implemented. This requires a scalabe and
        maintanable IT architecture with continuous integration and development.
        Automated tests guarantee quality and inforce trust in the processes.

      text: >
        We believe that each party involved in the creation of a product needs
        to invest themself seriously.

      text: >
        Life is too short to work with peoples you do not share common values
        with. Relations should benefit all parties involved. Initially parties
        must trust each other until proven unworthy.
