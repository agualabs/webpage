      header: Simplicity, clarity & transparency
      text: >
        Simplicity and effectiveness is key of any sustainable solution, be it digital or analog.
        Simplicity, transparency and clarity of thought belong to our core values.
        The work loads required to test, audit, maintain, document, teach shrink immensly.
        Scalibility is more likely in a simple setting.

      header: Open mindset & constant learning
      text: >
        Lean startup principles, agility and scrum methodology put rapid learning and product cycles first.
        Challenging your beliefs is a constant exercise.
        Each feature or idea has to be proven valuable.
        BI & data pipelines, A/B tests, metrics and KPIs need to be actionable and straight forward to understand.

      header: Focus on results and value
      text: >
        Anything created should have the intend to deliver more value than there was before.
        The internet is full of spam. We believe in earning our share in giving more than we ask for.
        It is common among developers that they put technologies first or think in their sweet spot only.
        We are very aware of these common traps and put product and value creation first.

      header: Speed, flexibility and quality
      text: >
        Better understanding of the customer can only result in better products if the new learnings are implemented.
        This requires a scalabe and maintanable IT architecture with continuous integration and development.
        Automated tests guarantee quality and inforce trust in the processes.

      header: Win-win relations only
      text: >
        Life is too short to work with peoples you do not share common values with.
        Relations should benefit all parties involved. Initially parties must trust each other until proven unworthy.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
